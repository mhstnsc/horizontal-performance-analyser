## Description

The problem is that current performance analysers are used to identify hot spots so they mostly work on vertical way, either top down or bottom up thus they cannot answer the question, how much is my `com.mypackage` cpu is actually using across its usages. This helps to understand where to put effort in performance optimizations and which libraries use the most CPU.

After running the analyser a report of used CPU is printed for each level of the packages.

## Status:

I've used it in production but its usage is not polished


## Usage

I forgot how to use it
